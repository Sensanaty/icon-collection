# Sensanaty's Icon Collection

This is my own personal collection of SVG icons that I either made or optimized for use in various projects of mine. It'll mostly consist of `svg` files, though there might be other formats thrown in there somewhere.

Feel free to use them however you'd like, no need to attribute me. They've all been run through Illustrator, so all of their viewBoxes will fit the object 100% snug, since I've noticed in a lot of Icon packs that they don't bother fitting the artboards to the final objects, which can lead to weird invisible margins that are hard to debug looking from the `svg` code alone.
